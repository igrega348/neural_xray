# Neural rendering and X-ray
Exploring the potential for neural rendering methods in x-ray tomography

## Objectives
X-ray computed tomography is an established method which can be used to obtain information about the internal composition of objects.
In this project, we try to answer the following two questions:
1. Can neural rendering methods (such as NeRF) be used to obtain similar information from a handful of projections (thereby reducing the required scanning time)?
2. Can such methods be used to calculate the deformation between two states of an object from a small number of projections?
